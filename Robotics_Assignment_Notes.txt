Loop Routine:
- Read from sensors
- Get robot x and y coordinates.
- If robot's current x and y meet target x and y (with error allowance), rougly 60cm from original position {
	- Update robot position, x and y.
	- Resize grid by one column/row in direction of front facing sensor.
		- Shift grid values and robot position if required.
	- Update grid values.
	- Evaluate if obstacle within 60cm in front of robot. 
	- Set new speed and direction (if necessary).
- Else adjust calculate difference in distance and adjust speed to avoid overshooting target.
